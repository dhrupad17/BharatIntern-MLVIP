Today I am working on a House-Price Prediction Project

Steps
------

Model Building
===============

1) Taken Bengaluru House Price Dataset from Kaggle
2) After the boiler's steps in jupyter notebook I have performed value counts on each column
3) Checked for null values,dropped columns and filled null with some apt values as required
4) Now converted the range of values to fixed columns 
5) Calculated price_per_sqft as new column
6) We have to reduce location values as it has so many counts
7) If location count <=10 make it to other
8) Now removing outliers
9)
